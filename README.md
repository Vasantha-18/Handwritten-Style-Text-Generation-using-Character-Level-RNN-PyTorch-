✍️ Handwritten-Style Text Generation using Character-Level RNN (PyTorch)
This project implements a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using PyTorch to generate handwritten-like text sequences. The model is trained on a sample text corpus and learns to predict the next character based on a sequence of previous characters, mimicking the flow of handwritten text.

📌 Features
Character-level LSTM-based RNN

One-hot encoding for character input representation

Simple training loop for sequence learning

Text generation based on learned patterns

Easily extensible to larger text corpora

🧠 Model Architecture
Input: One-hot encoded characters

Model: LSTM layer → Fully connected layer

Output: Next character prediction

Loss: CrossEntropyLoss

Optimizer: Adam

📦 Dependencies
Python 3.x

PyTorch

NumPy

Install using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch numpy
🚀 How It Works
Preprocess the Data: Clean and tokenize the input text into character sequences.

One-Hot Encode each character for input to the RNN.

Train the RNN to predict the next character using LSTM cells.

Generate Text using the trained model, starting with a prompt.
